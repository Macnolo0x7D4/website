      <h1>üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Hi! I'm Manolo!</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to my live portfolio! You will find here a collection of my
        projects and a little bit about me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a software developer from Mexico. I'm passionate about technology
        and I love to learn new things.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started when I was 8 years old while trying to understand how video
        games and operating systems works. And that curiosity was huge, so I
        started learning about programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, as I grew up, I started creating websites with Django, Rails and
        Phoenix, as Backend, and React, Angular, NextJS and Svelte, as Frontend.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was also interested in developing mobile applications for Android
        using Kotlin and with Swift for iOS and macOS.
      </p>
      <p>And I also teach Java programming courses focused on robotics.</p>
