      Welcome to my live portfolio! Here, you'll find a collection of my projects and learn a bit about me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a software developer from Mexico, passionate about technology and constantly seeking new knowledge. My journey began when I was just 8 years old, driven by a deep curiosity about how video games and operating systems worked, which led me to start learning programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I grew, I began building websites using backend frameworks like <strong>Phoenix LiveView</strong>, <strong>Django</strong>, and <strong>Rails</strong>, complemented by frontend technologies such as <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Angular</strong>, <strong>Next.js</strong>, and <strong>Svelte</strong>. My interest extended to mobile development, creating applications for Android with <strong>Kotlin</strong> and for iOS/macOS using <strong>Swift</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I teach Java programming courses with a focus on robotics and love mentoring students who are just starting their programming journey. I'm also very passionate about fintech topics and love experimenting with AI and data science. Currently, I'm pursuing my Software Engineering degree while diving into complex software architectures and aspiring to become a software architect.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or sharing knowledge with the developer community through my non-profit organization.
