    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <div class="mt-2">
      <p>I've been coding in <strong>Java</strong> for over <strong>8 years</strong>, working with stuff like <strong>Spring, WPILib, LWJGL, and Android development</strong>. I've also dabbled in <strong>Kotlin</strong> and <strong>Scala</strong>.</p>
      <p>As for <strong>TypeScript</strong>, I actually started with <strong>JavaScript over 10 years ago</strong>. I switched to TypeScript because it helps smooth out some of JavaScript's rough edges. I've used it with frameworks like <strong>React, Next.js, Svelte, Angular</strong>, and lots of other JS tools.</p>
      <p>Then there's <strong>Elixir</strong>. I've been using it <strong>professionally for about 2 years</strong> now. I really enjoy the way it works and I'm always eager to learn more.</p>
      <p>I've also worked with other languages like <strong>Python, Ruby, C/C++, C#, Swift, and Go</strong>.</p>
      <p>On the database side, I'm familiar with relational databases like <strong>PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and SQLite</strong>, as well as NoSQL ones like <strong>MongoDB and Redis</strong>.</p>
      <p>Cloud-wise, I've got experience with <strong>AWS, GCP, and Azure</strong>. Since I use Linux daily, I'm comfortable managing <strong>Linux servers</strong> too.</p>
      <p>I enjoy designing software architecture, especially using approaches like <strong>Domain-Driven Design</strong> or <strong>Hexagonal Architecture</strong>. Designing <strong>microservices</strong> is also something I've done.</p>
      <p>I am used to working with agile methodologies such as <strong>Scrum</strong> and <strong>Extreme Programming (XP)</strong>, and I often practice <strong>Test Driven Development (TDD)</strong>.</p>
      <p>Right now, I'm digging into <strong>Rust</strong> and <strong>Clojure</strong>, and I'm curious about <strong>Zig</strong> too.</p>
